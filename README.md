# Movie List App
I just wanted to make this app fast usable/clonable without 3rd party libraries. Created 100% Programmatically and with MVVM Architecture.

The application is completed. Easy to clonable here w/o 3rd party libraries: https://github.com/CanerCagri/MovieList---Mvvm/tree/a2ff92cffe1118c91815ca718268838978c5b8b4

**But from now, I will start implementing 3rd party libraries in a different git branch.**
